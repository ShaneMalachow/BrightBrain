A health and wellness app for students to track results and analytics for their health.

Have you ever wanted to have actual analytics to your health and wellness? Did you ever wonder how your diet affects your grades? That's what BrightBrain is for.

BrightBrain Online is a web application that allows students to track daily activities, including diet, exercise, and sleep, and measure how it affects their daily performance. It tracks grades through Canvas and measures your sleep through self-reporting. Using these trends, it makes recommendations for the user in how to improve their day to day life.
